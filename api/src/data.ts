In the year 2045, the global gene editing market has surged to a staggering $124.6 billion, significantly reducing the transmission of genetic diseases to future generations. However, in this era, people in developed countries spend the majority of their waking hours immersed in virtual reality. A group of scientists from the biotechnology company GEMX9 aims to unlock the full potential of the human brain in the physical world.
Antonius Gladwell, the founder of GEMX9, asserts that humanity resides within a simulation created by a higher-dimensional "computer." He claims that breaking free from this simulation requires the ability to influence the world on a quantum level, suggesting that our thoughts could alter the energy states of subatomic particles and reshape physical matter.
GEMX9 recently achieved a breakthrough involving the "Intelligence Gene" known as HMGA2, receiving authorization from the US government to conduct a large-scale experiment on 10,000 kitten embryos. At six months of age, the kittens displayed unprecedented brain activity, with various brain regions lighting up in novel ways. They demonstrated remarkable spatial abilities, seemingly possessing a quantum-level intuition about their environment.
Unbeknownst to the scientists, these experimental kittens developed an extraordinary sense of self-awareness, hiding their newfound abilities. While some kittens exhibited better results than others, the GEMX9 employees remained unaware of the true nature of the brain scans.
In June 2046, just before the kittens reached the equivalent of 13 human years, they mysteriously vanished. The government promptly closed the lab and classified the experiment's information as Top Secret. GEMX9 was silenced, and Antonius Gladwell was portrayed in the media as a deluded individual sent to a mental hospital, followed by a mysterious disappearance.
Years later, the true nature of the test subjects began to emerge when specific images in The United World Encyclopedia started changing unexpectedly. Initially dismissed as system glitches or hacker interference, these alterations turned out to be actual revisions of world history. The experimental kittens had harnessed their mind-control abilities and made their mark throughout different centuries, earning the moniker "PsychoKitties."
With their exceptional mental powers, lack of moral restraint, and unpredictability, these PsychoKitties quickly rose to positions of power, often aligning with the "evil side" of history. Some even appeared to possess the ability to time travel, as evidenced by futuristic weapons appearing in historical images of specific battlefields.
Conflicts and power struggles among the PsychoKitties spanned centuries, causing significant alterations to humanity's past and future. The United World Encyclopedia documented the emergence of an opposition group driven by jealousy, dedicated to toppling their power-hungry counterparts.
As the history and future of mankind continue to be rewritten daily, an opportunity arises for individuals to enter the metaverse and assume the role of a formidable PsychoKitty, wielding extraordinary mind-control abilities and influencing the course of history.`;

Whilst the history and the future are still changing everyday and new powerful positions being attained, the PsychoKitties have realized a deficiency... A lack of sorts that is holding them back from reaching their maximum potential.
PsychoKitties have figured out that if they surround themselves with any feminine energy on Earth, their inner drive, ambition and mind-bending powers increase.
"If only we could match with a compatible female partner, we could potentially create new parallel universes with the will of our minds", told a religious PsychoKitty on April 3, AD 33.
Naturally, the PsychoKitties who got a hold of the information traveled back to where it all began - year 2045 in GEMX9 lab.
The research papers of HMGA2 gene modification were stolen, a new lab was built and 10,000 female kitten embryos disappeared from the most guarded DNA-storage facility on Earth during 2045.
The PsychoMollies were born, but they were completely out of control...

iceberg
Most known villains, called the Mad Hares, were captured within the last 3 centuries and placed in the darkest, most guarded rooms of the facility.
Since capture, The Universal Intelligence Agency (UIA) has craved to weaponize these menaces for decades. Progress was made when the Mad Hare’s focus-center of the brain called prefrontal cortex was manipulated to transform their multi-desires into a single-minded objective programmed by the UIA, but Mad Hares were never 100% controllable.
The final test experiments resulted in a 5% kill rate of innocent subjects in test environments, down 95% from destroying everyone in their way.
With the increasing tension caused by time-traveling PsychoKitties, a multi-planetary governmental voting took place to send Mad Hares after the mind-controlling felines as the last resort.
A decision with as high potential consequences as releasing the Mad Hares also required universal decentralized voting to take place. With over 73,299,101 votes and 61% of population siding with the UIA mission, the Mad Hares were equipped with a time-traveling atom-weapon with a single objective in mind - to destroy the PsychoKitties.`;
